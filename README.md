SHOULD I STAY OR SHOULD I GO: UNDERSTANDING EMPLOYEE ATTRITION IN THE WORKPLACE

The following report will approach the business problems associated with employee attrition within
organisations, using practical business techniques and a data-driven approach. The business
problem and objectives will be defined in detail, the data and data mining techniques used to meet
these business objectives discussed, and a guided step-by-step outline of the process shared.
The project will follow the CRISP-DM iterative methodology, with each choice and assumption
explained. By the end of the report, the business problem will be evaluated, with results and
conclusions explored.
